TestRunner is a unit testing tool made up of just an XSL document, for javascript projects.

*Some Goals*
  * Simple to start and use, just one file
  * HTML layout for monitoring results. Just one click is enought to execute hundreds tests!
  * Seperating, Grouping test cases
  * Asynchronous tests
  * Display and Firebug options for inspecting DOM tests


*Supported Layout Engines*
  * Gecko
  * Webkit

h2. How It Works

  TestRunner needs to be pointed from an XML document that declares test cases which will be executed. When this document is being run by a web browser, it works as a web application that let you to execute test cases you defined.You can run all of them in this layout by a single click or you can pick which test case you want to run. TestRunner creates an iframe window and executes test scripts in this window. Test scripts can throw exception or use extra functions defined by TestRunner. For now, TestRunner gives them 3 functions; assert, compare and log.

h2. Basic Usage

  * Create an XML document that defines the test cases will be run. For instance;<pre><code><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <testcases>
      <case>
        <file src="tests/math.js" /> 
        <dependency src="lib/math.js" /> 
      </case>
      <case>
       <file src="tests/datetime.js" /> 
        <dependency src="lib/datetime.js" /> 
        <dependency src="lib/i18n.js" /> 
      </case>
      <case display='true' firebug='true'>
        <file src="tests/dom.js" /> 
        <dependency src="lib/jQuery.js" /> 
      </case>
    </testcases></code></pre>

  * Import TestRunner by adding this line into top of this document:
    <pre><code><?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="../testrunner.xsl"?>
    </code></pre>

  * It's ready to be opened in a web browser. Try to execute the tests you declared above. You will notice "Ran 0 tests" message in the monitor. It means, TestRunner couldn't find any test functions to run.

  * Now let's define some test functions. The functions which will be run by TestRunner should have 'test_' prefix in their names.
   <pre><code>
    // html5.js
    log('hello world');
    //
    var test_worker = function(){
      assert( window.Worker );
    }
    //
    var test_async = function(){
      setTimeout(function(){
        test_async.result = true;
      },1000);
    }
    test_async.async = true;
    //
    // this function will not be run becauseof its naming.
    var do_sth = function(){
      compare('give me','an error');
    }
    // 
    var test_sth = function(){
      do_sth(); // it will raise a comparasion error
    }</code></pre>
  
  * That's all.
